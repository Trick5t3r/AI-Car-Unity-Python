# AI-Car-Unity-Python
A car built on Unity3D and driven by artificial intelligence coded on python. 

An old project (coded in 2017) a little messy but that I share with you because it is very fun.
The "reconnaissance_faciale_v2.py" program allows you to drive the car with your own head, while the "server_python_for_unity3d_v3.py" program drives the car automatically and learns from its mistakes.
